MSDS 6371 â€“ KAGGLE PROJECT
Introduction
           Century 21 Ames has commissioned us to answer how the sale price of their houses in the North Ames Edwards and Brookside neighborhoods are related to the square footage of the living area of the house. Additionally, they would like to know if the sales price (and its relationship to square footage) depends on which neighborhood the house is located in. I. answering this we have been asked to build the most predictive model for sales prices of homes in all of Ames, Iowa (This includes all of the neighborhoods).
